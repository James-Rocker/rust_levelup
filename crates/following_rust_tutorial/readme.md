# Learnings

This crate is going to be following "The Rust Programming Language 2nd Edition".

## Notes

These commands might be obvious to someone using the language on a daily basis. I do not though.
`cargo check` - checks to see if the code compiles but doesn't build anything
`cargo fmt` - auto formats `bin` and `lib` files with rustfmt

## Commands
`cargo run --bin guessing_game` - runs the guessing game program
